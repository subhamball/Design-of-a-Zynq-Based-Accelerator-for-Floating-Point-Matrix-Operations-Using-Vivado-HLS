# Design-of-a-Zynq-Based-Accelerator-for-Floating-Point-Matrix-Operations-Using-Vivado-HLS
Implemented a 32x32 matrix multiplication core on Xilinx FPGAs using C/C++ with Vivado HLS. This cost-effective and power-efficient solution, connected to Zynq-7000 AP SoC PS via DMA, outperforms ARM CPU software execution.
